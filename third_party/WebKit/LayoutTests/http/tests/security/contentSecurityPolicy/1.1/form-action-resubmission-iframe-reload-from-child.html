<!--
  This test documents the current behavior with Content-Security-Policy and
  form resubmission. It makes a first navigation with a form submission in an
  iframe, then the iframe reloads itself. This is a form resubmission. The
  thing is that the iframe has set the "form-action 'none'" policy and so the
  reload is blocked.
