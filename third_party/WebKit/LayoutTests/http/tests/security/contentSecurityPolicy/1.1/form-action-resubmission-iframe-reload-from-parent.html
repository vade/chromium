  This test documents the current behavior with Content-Security-Policy and
  form resubmission. It makes a first navigation with a form submission in an
  iframe and then makes the iframe reload. This is a form resubmission. The
  thing is that the iframe has the "form-action 'none'" policy and the
  navigation is blocked. It is blocked even if the reload was initiated by a
  frame that has not defined any policies.
  TODO(mkwst). This seems wrong.
