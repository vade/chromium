  This test documents the current behavior with Content-Security-Policy and
  form resubmission. It makes a first navigation with a form submission in a
  new window and then the window reloads itself. This is a form resubmission.
  The thing is that the window has the "form-action 'none'" policy and the
  navigation is blocked.
