  This test documents the current behavior with Content-Security-Policy and
  form resubmission. It makes a first navigation with a form submission, then
  the next page reloads itself. This is a form resubmission. The thing is that
  the second page has set the "form-action 'none'" policy. The reload is
  blocked.
