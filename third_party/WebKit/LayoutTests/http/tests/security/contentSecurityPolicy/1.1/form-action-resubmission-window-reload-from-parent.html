<!--
  This test documents the current behavior with Content-Security-Policy and
  form resubmission. It makes a first navigation with a form submission in a
  new window and then makes it reload. This is a form resubmission. The thing
  is that the window has the "form-action 'none'" policy and the navigation is
  blocked. It is blocked even if the navigation was initiated by a window that
  has not defined any policies.
  TODO(mkwst). This seems wrong.
