The test suites in this directory are synced with third-party repos.

In particular the tests in web-platform-tests and csswg-test are
imported from the W3C's test suite repositories on GitHub, and changes
to web-platform-tests should be exported to the upstream repo.

Use Tools/Scripts/update-w3c-deps to update the tests from the tip of
tree in those repositories.

It is safe and okay to check in generic baselines for any tests that fail.
The baselines will not be overwritten.

For more information on this process and Blink's handling of the W3C's
test suites, see http://www.chromium.org/blink/importing-the-w3c-tests.
