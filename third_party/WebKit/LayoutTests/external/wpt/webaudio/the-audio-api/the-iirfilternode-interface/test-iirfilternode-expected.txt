This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS IIRFilterNode coefficients are checked properly 
PASS feedforward coefficients can not be empty 
PASS feedback coefficients can not be empty 
PASS more than 20 feedforward coefficients can not be used 
PASS more than 20 feedback coefficients can not be used 
PASS at least one feedforward coefficient must be non-zero 
PASS the first feedback coefficient must be non-zero 
FAIL IIRFilterNode getFrequencyResponse handles invalid frequencies properly assert_true: Invalid input frequency should give NaN magnitude response expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
